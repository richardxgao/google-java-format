Copy of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/eclipse-java-google-style.xml with the following changes:
* join_lines_in_comments = False (instead of True)
* continuation_indentation = 1 (instead of 2)
* join_wrapped_lines = False (instead of True)

Allows for the following:

The above also applies to comments so bullet points in comments don't get unnecessarily joined into one line.
